🎉 Welcome to the ultimate **User Management System** designed with security, efficiency, and user experience in mind. This system leverages the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and utilizes **JSON Web Tokens** (JWT) for secure **Authentication** and **Authorization**. Below is an overview of the key features that make this system a robust and reliable solution for managing user accounts and protecting sensitive data.

### 🪛 Getting Started

The quickest way to get started as shown below:

#### 🌐 Frontend Environment Variables Setup (.env)
Create a .env file in the ***frontend*** directory of your React project and define the following environment variables:

```
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=     # The base URL of your backend API, e.g., http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=     # WebSocket server URL, e.g., ws://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_BASE_URL=       # Base URL of the frontend application, e.g., http://localhost:3000
REACT_APP_SITE_KEY=       # reCAPTCHA v2 or v3 Site Key (used on the client side)
```

> ⚠️ Note: All environment variables in React must begin with REACT_APP_ to be accessible in the app.

#### 🔧 Backend Environment Variables Setup (.env)
Create a .env file in the ***backend*** directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```
# Server Configuration
PORT=              # Port for the backend server, e.g., 5000
REACT_PORT=        # Port for the frontend React app, e.g., 3000
SERVER_URL=        # Full backend URL, e.g., http://localhost:5000
CLIENT_URL=        # Full frontend URL, e.g., http://localhost:3000

# Database & Cache
DATABASE_URL=      # Database connection string, e.g., mongodb://localhost:27017/<database>
REDIS_URL=         # Redis host, e.g., 127.0.0.1
REDIS_PORT=        # Redis port, e.g., 6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=    # Redis password (leave blank if not set)

# Token & Security Secrets
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=       # Secret for generating access tokens
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=      # Secret for generating refresh tokens
SESSION_TOKEN_SECRET=      # Secret for session tokens
OTP_TOKEN_SECRET=          # Secret used for generating OTP codes

# Third-Party Services
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=          # Google OAuth Client ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=      # Google OAuth Client Secret
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=      # Google reCAPTCHA secret key

# Admin Credentials (for initial setup)
ADMIN_EMAIL=               # Default admin email
ADMIN_PASS=                # Default admin password
``` 

> ⚠️ Note: Never commit your .env file to version control. Be sure to include it in your .gitignore file to keep sensitive information secure.

##### Server Side

```bash
cd Backend
npm i && npm run dev
```

##### Client Side

```bash
cd Frontend
npm i && npm run start
```
